Exercice 3:
    Theoritical work:
        1) What is the role of the butter, cheby1, freqz, and iidesign functions in this code?
        - butter: Design an Nth-order digital or analog Butterworth filter and return the filter coefficients.
        - cheby1: Design an Nth-order digital or analog Chebyshev type I filter and return the filter coefficients.
        - freqz: This function computes the frequency response of a digital filter.
        - iidesign: not found
    Practical work: 
        1) What is the main difference between the Butterworth filter and the Chebyshev Type I filter in terms of frequency response?
        - Chebyshev Type 1 has a really narrow transition band unlike Butterworth, however, Butterworth is smoother with less ripples.
        2) Why is the transition band of the Chebyshev Type I filter narrower than that of the Butterworth filter?
        - It is narrower because the filter can achieve a faster transition from the passband to the stopband due to Chebyshev filter being a type of filter
        that has a steeper and sharper frequency response.
        3) What is the impact of group delay on the signal for the Butterworth filter?
        - less signal distortion
